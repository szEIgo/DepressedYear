## Questions:
1. How do the flight phases (ex. take off, cruise, landing..) contribute to fatalities? Chart!
2. Which 5 locations saw the most injuries in the US? Show it on a barchart! \*
3. Which 5 aircraft models had the most injuries (fatal, serious, minor)? Show them on a piechart!
4. What was the distribution of fatal injuries during the last 20 years? Show it on a barchart!
5. [UPDATED] What was the survival rate (how many died / how many survived) for substantially damaged AND destroyed aircrafts since 1993, showing data for each year. Show results on a stacked bar plot. (see more in notebook 14 - Intro to plotting / example 62.) \**

## Notes:
- Be wary of missing data in the columns

- \* Injuries are counted from the _Total Serious Injuries_ and _Total Minor Injuries_ columns (by default fatal injuries are not counted here)

- \** Survivals are counted from the three columns with injuries that are non-fatal (serious, minor injuries and uninjured)

groupMembers = ['Emil Klausen', 'Edmond Petres, 'Lucas Fredmark', 'Plamen Getsov']
