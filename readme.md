What was the distribution of fatal injuries during the last 20 years? Show it on a barchart!
[UPDATED] What was the survival rate (how many died / how many survived) for substantially damaged AND destroyed aircrafts since 1993, showing data for each year. Show results on a stacked bar plot. (see more in notebook 14 - Intro to plotting / example 62.) **
